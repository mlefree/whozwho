# WhozWho Project Brief

## Project Overview
WhozWho is an actor-based system for managing distributed updates and role assignments. It provides a framework for dynamic actor registration, lifecycle tracking, role assignment, and coordinated updates across distributed systems.

## Core Requirements

### Actor Management
- Dynamic actor registration and lifecycle tracking
- Real-time status monitoring of actors
- Comprehensive actor state management

### Role Assignment
- Smart principal role determination based on weight and activity
- Dynamic role transitions based on system state
- Role-based permissions and capabilities

### Update Coordination
- Distributed update propagation with advice system
- Coordinated version updates across actors
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Project Goals
- Create a reliable system for managing distributed actor networks
- Provide seamless update coordination across distributed components
- Ensure robust error handling and system resilience
- Maintain high performance even with numerous actors
- Support scalable architecture for growing actor networks

## Technical Scope
- Node.js and TypeScript-based implementation
- Express.js for API endpoints
- MongoDB for data persistence
- RESTful API design for actor and advice management
- Comprehensive testing suite

## Success Criteria
- Successful actor registration and role assignment
- Reliable update propagation across distributed actors
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation and API specifications
