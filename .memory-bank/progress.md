# WhozWho Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Actor registration and lifecycle management
- ✅ Role assignment based on weight and activity
- ✅ Distributed update propagation via advice system
- ✅ Real-time status monitoring
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints for actor and advice management

### API Endpoints
- ✅ POST /hi - Register actor's presence and status
- ✅ POST /actors - Query actor's role status
- ✅ GET /status - Get system status
- ✅ POST /advices - Suggest advice to actor's categories
- ✅ GET /advices - Get my last advices
- ✅ PUT /advices/:adviceId - Update advice status

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Node.js 22.x support
- ✅ TypeScript 5.x implementation
- ✅ Express 4.x framework integration
- ✅ MongoDB 4.4+ database integration
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
- ✅ Test suite with integration and unit tests

## What's Left to Build

### Feature Enhancements
- 🔄 Additional advice types beyond UPDATE
- 🔄 Enhanced monitoring capabilities for distributed actor networks
- 🔄 Advanced role assignment algorithms
- 🔄 Real-time WebSocket status updates

### Documentation

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
- ⚠️ Performance degradation may occur in high-load scenarios with many concurrent actors
- ⚠️ MongoDB connection pooling needs optimization for large-scale deployments
- ⚠️ Some edge cases in role transition during network partitions need further testing

### Documentation Issues
- ⚠️ API documentation lacks comprehensive examples for all endpoints
- ⚠️ Performance testing guidelines need to be expanded
- ⚠️ Deployment documentation for various environments needs enhancement

### Feature Limitations
- ⚠️ Advice system currently only supports UPDATE type
- ⚠️ Role assignment algorithm may not be optimal in all network configurations
- ⚠️ Recovery mechanisms for failed actors could be more sophisticated

This document tracks the current progress of the WhozWho project, including completed features, pending work, current status, and known issues. It should be updated regularly as development progresses and issues are resolved.
