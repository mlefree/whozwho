## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Maintaining the actor-based architecture as the core design pattern
- Continuing with the RESTful API approach for all interactions
- Keeping MongoDB as the primary data store due to its flexibility and scalability

### Technical Considerations
- Evaluating the potential upgrade to Mongoose 8.x in a future release
- Considering the addition of WebSocket support for real-time status updates
- Exploring containerization improvements for easier deployment

### Development Process
- Maintaining the current CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
- Continuing with the semantic versioning approach for releases
- Emphasizing test coverage for all new features and bug fixes

### Open Questions
- Should the advice system be expanded to support more types beyond UPDATE?
- Is there a need for a more sophisticated role assignment algorithm?
- How can we improve the recovery mechanisms for failed actors?
