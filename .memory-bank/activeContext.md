## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Maintaining the actor-based architecture as the core design pattern
- Continuing with the RESTful API approach for all interactions
- Keeping MongoDB as the primary data store due to its flexibility and scalability

### Technical Considerations
- Evaluating the potential upgrade to Mongoose 8.x in a future release
- Considering the addition of WebSocket support for real-time status updates
- Exploring containerization improvements for easier deployment

### Development Process
- Maintaining the current CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
- Continuing with the semantic versioning approach for releases
- Emphasizing test coverage for all new features and bug fixes

### Open Questions
- Should the advice system be expanded to support more types beyond UPDATE?
- Is there a need for a more sophisticated role assignment algorithm?
- How can we improve the recovery mechanisms for failed actors?

This document reflects the current state of development and active considerations for the WhozWho project. It should be updated regularly as the project evolves and new decisions are made.
